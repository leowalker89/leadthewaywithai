minimal, static informational site built around practical AI systems, healthcare
AI, agentic workflows, and teaching/writing.

for teaching, writing, mentoring, and consulting around practical AI systems.

## Tech stack

- [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

  (`sage`), slate blues (`slate`), deep terracotta accent (`terracotta`).
- **Typography:** Fraunces for display headings, Inter for body and UI chrome.
- **Accessibility:** semantic HTML, skip link, visible focus states, responsive
  mobile-first layout, descriptive link text, and per-page metadata + Open Graph.
